description = The pinnacle of Karborundum drive technology, the 'Bonfire' torch drive is an incredibly efficient, high thrust mass conversion engine powered by a mixture of Karborundum and Ore, a lot of electricity, and witchcraft.  Some things to note:  The torch drive has extreme thrust, designed for pushing heavy freighters at 1G for days.  If tied to a much lighter ship, be careful of excess G-forces crushing the crew.  Also - remember it takes as much time to slow down as it does to accelerate!
