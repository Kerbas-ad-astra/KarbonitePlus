title = KFD-500 Torch Drive 
manufacturer = Umbra Space Industries
description = The pinnacle of Karborundum drive technology, the torch drive is an incredibly efficient, high thrust mass conversion engine powered by Karborundum, a lot of electricity, and witchcraft.  Some things to note:  The torch drive has extreme thrust, designed for pushing heavy freighters at 1G for days.  If tied to a much lighter ship, be careful of excess G-forces crushing the crew.  Also - remember it takes as much time to slow down as it does to accellerate!
